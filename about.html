<h5>Time and Mindset <span>Organization.</span></h5>

<p>Time and Mindset Organization is an organization based on social, economic, spiritual and physical work of life.<br>It is a group of youths with sound minds and ideas on how problems affecting the globe can be solved using solutions from the past.<br>Members in this organization do believe that by using solutions from ancient times of where we are coming from, for sure no problem the world is facing today can remain unsolved. This is because, we do know that any problem has a beginning and a solution attached to it.<br>This can be by reversing what really happened, as the best way, or finding another one to tackle it by analyzing it well. So, by looking down the history, we find that each problem we have today, had a beginning somewhere, and this is why this organization has an aim “solving present problems with solutions from the past.”</p>
